# R markdown file
Create your R markdown file as usual! But keep track of your libraries, as we will need to tell binder to install all our needed packages in the install.R file.

# runtime.txt
This file is where we specify our R environment (R version) using the following syntax:
r-YYYY-MM-DD

You can access a full list of R versions [here].

# install.R 
This file is where we specify all our packages need to run our R markdown.
